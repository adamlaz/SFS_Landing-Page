<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>For examples, please see <code>tests/example.php</code> which you can view in a browser or
run from the command line.</p>
<h2 id="conformance">Conformance</h2>
<p>You&#39;ll need the test data which is in YAML format from the following
repository:</p>
<pre><code>http://github.com/mzsanford/twitter-text-conformance
</code></pre><p>It has already been added as a git submodule so you should just need to run:</p>
<pre><code>git submodule init
git submodule update
</code></pre><p>As PHP has no native support for YAML you&#39;ll need to checkout spyc from svn
into <code>tests/spyc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>svn checkout http://spyc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tests/spyc
</code></pre><p>There are a couple of options for testing conformance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run <code>phpunit</code> in from the root folder of the project.</li>
<li>Run <code>tests/runtests.php</code> from the command line.</li>
<li>Make <code>tests/runtests.php</code> accessible on a web server and view it in your
browser.</li>
</ol>
